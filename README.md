# pythonTools-jsonTree
Python Class used to import/export and manipulate json documents using Python. The Class was build using visual studio code and is still in its testing phase so feel free to report any bugs.

The purpose of this class is to simplify import/export, manipulation of json objects, by create a Tree of Nodes that reflects the json Objects Tree structure, using python and hopefully at some point integrate jsonTree with a GUI so that jsonTree objects can be visualized to make jsonTree a powerfull class for json document manipulation.

The goal of jsonTree is that when it good enough of deployment that it can be used together with noSQL databases to build noSQL Database GUI's.
